# Testing methodology: (Ka Shing)
The testing team follows closely alongside every step of the development process. To ensure that all requirements are met and bugs are fixed as soon as possible, several testing methodologies are employed. The testing methodologies that were employed include:
1. Unit testing
2. Integration testing
3. System testing
4. UI/UX testing

## Unit testing
Unit testing is a software testing process which focuses on inidvidual units of source code, such as a functions in a program.  Unit tests are usually written once and reused so that the tests can be automated after a change in the source code. Our team will take a semi-automated approach to unit testing. The purpose of unit testing is to ensure that each unit performs as intended and helps to speed up the debugging process during and after development. Unit tests are white box tests as the test designers have to understand the inputs and outputs of the unit to test it effectively. There are a few guidelines set by our team for unit testing:

1. Unit tests should cover both right and wrong inputs
2. Unit tests should test for the boundary value of a unit
3. Each unit test should be fast and small
4. Each unit test should only cover one unit
5. Results should be documented and bugs should be reported

## Integration testing
Integration testing should take place after unit testing. It tests the integration of individual software modules to check if they work together when combined. The main purpose of integration testing is to uncover defects present between modules when they are integrated. Hence, integration test is a white box test since testers are required to understand all functions of the code base. The team will take a semi-automated approach in this phase of testing. The follow are guidelines set by our team for integration testing:
1. The team shall use a bottom-up approach to integration testing
2. Unit testing shall be done before integration testing
3. Integration testing should only test for the integration between modules rather than the functionality of the modules.

# Records â€“ collection, maintenance and retention (Ka Shing)
Documentation related to SQA is kept for future reference and to be shared with stakeholders. The Software Quality Assurance plan as well as the Test Case Documentation will be collected, maintained, and retained in our Github repository. In addition, the results of the tests will be maintained as quality records for future reference.
