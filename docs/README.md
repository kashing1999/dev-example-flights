# SQA Tasks (Vinuri)
- Explain what activities are we going to do

# Standards, practice conventions and metrics (Hanna)
## Document standards:
## Coding standards:
## Test Standards:

# Metrics (that we have set): (Vinuri)
** additional documentation ** can show the template of documentation u guys follow for test case, peer review, bug report etc

# Problem reporting and corrective actions (Yu Jie)
All problems will be reported after each software review or testing is carried out. The leader of the project will review the bug report and determine the severity of the bug (low, medium, high) before passing it to the developer team that is responsible for fixing the bugs found. The developer team will apply the changes to the software according to the severity of bug while making sure there is no collision with any other part of the software. The outcome will be reviewed again to ensure all the bugs are fixed. 

# Tools and technologies source code management (Yu Jie)
Git is used as the version control system to manage the documents and source code of the project. It is installed and maintained on the local system of each team member's devices and provides a self-contained record of the ongoing programming versions. Github is also used as an assist together with Git to allow team collaboration through cloud. GitHub is a code hosting platform that provides Git repository hosting service. It allows the team members to share their codes or documents to each other through remote repository and carry out version control at the same time.   

# Testing methodology: (Ka Shing)
- Can describe each step how u guys carry out the testing etc
    1. Unit test
    2. Integration test
    3. System test
        <br>System testing is a black-box testing technique and it does not require internal knowledge of the code. It is done after the integration testing and it mainly focus on testing the functionality and features of the system as a whole. Inputs are provided to the system and the outputs are verified according to the expectations stated in the test cases. Test cases is created at the beginning to determine all the aspects to be covered in the system testing. Each test cases are written based on the real-time usage of the software. After the execution of all the test cases, any bugs found are documented in the bug report. 
    4. UI and UX test
# Records â€“ collection, maintenance and retention (Ka Shing) 
- The following documents will be collected, maintained, and retained in the appropriate software configuration management repository:
    - Software Quality Assurance Plan
    - Test Case Documentation
- In addition, the following will be maintained as quality records:
    - Test results
